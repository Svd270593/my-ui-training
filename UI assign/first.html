<h2>Venkat dheeraj</h2> 
<span>Hello, I am venkat dheeraj. Let me give a brief intro about me, well lets start with my present situation, I've completed my masters in electrical and computer engineering, from
southern illinois university carbondale. </span>

<p> This is my 2nd year in U.S.A., its a wonderful place to visit and wonderful people around. I always had a thought I'd have visited all the place in India if i had the same freedom and flexibility to move around.
I've been to many states in U.S.A, yet lot of places to cover. Well few of them are.</p>
